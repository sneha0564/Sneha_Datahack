the model predict how likely individuals are to receive their xyz and seasonal flu
vaccines.
initially i imported the necessary library i.e pandas as pd & then the datasets given: training (features& labels) and testing. and merged the train_lables with train_features. then to fill in the missing values (imputation) with Scikit-Learn, i used SimpleImputer, and filled the missing values with the most frequent values in that corresponding column. i then made a object of class label encoder and then apply it on the target variables and save the result in the original dataframe.  then using StandardScaler i obtain zero-mean, unit standard-deviation. and then using roc auc i evaluated the model performance and choose the best one as my final submission.
